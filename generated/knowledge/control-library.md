Evidence examples:
- finding record
- root-cause analysis
- corrective-action plan
- verification
- control update

Implementation notes: Closure should require evidence of effectiveness rather than completion of an administrative task.

## AI-VSC-006: Vendor customer-data training restrictions

Domain: Vendor Supply Chain
Layer: Both

Objective: Prevent unauthorized vendor use of organizational data to train or improve AI.

Requirement: Contracts and service configurations shall prohibit provider training, fine-tuning, evaluation, or product improvement using organizational data unless the use is explicitly authorized, bounded, documented, and monitored.

Applicability statement: Applies when third-party AI receives organizational, customer, employee, or other non-public data.

Applicability mode: human_determination
Applicable contexts: general_ai_usage, ai_system, vendor_ai
Applicability rationale: Third-party involvement and provider training or improvement settings are not established by the current intake.

Evidence examples:
- contract clause
- provider setting
- data-flow review
- authorization
- monitoring evidence

Implementation notes: Address prompts, outputs, uploads, feedback, telemetry, embeddings, and derived datasets separately.

## AI-VSC-007: Vendor AI artifact deletion and return

Domain: Vendor Supply Chain
Layer: Both

Objective: Ensure organizational data and AI-derived artifacts can be securely removed or returned.

Requirement: Material AI suppliers shall support verified deletion or return of customer data, prompts, outputs, embeddings, fine-tunes, memory, logs, and derived artifacts upon request, expiration, or termination, subject to documented legal exceptions.

Applicability statement: Applies where suppliers store or derive artifacts from organizational data.

Applicability mode: human_determination
Applicable contexts: general_ai_usage, ai_system, vendor_ai
Applicability rationale: Supplier storage and derivation of AI artifacts are not established by the current intake.

Evidence examples:
- deletion clause
- retention schedule
- deletion request
- attestation
- technical deletion test

Implementation notes: Define treatment of backups, legal holds, de-identified data, and artifacts embedded in trained or tuned models.

## AI-VSC-008: Vendor AI incident notification and cooperation

Domain: Vendor Supply Chain
Layer: Both

Objective: Obtain timely information and assistance for AI-related incidents and failures.

Requirement: Supplier agreements shall define AI security, privacy, misuse, availability, model-behavior, and control incidents; notification timelines; required information; evidence preservation; cooperation; remediation; and continuing updates.

Applicability statement: Applies to material third-party AI services and dependencies.

Applicability mode: human_determination
Applicable contexts: general_ai_usage, ai_system, vendor_ai
Applicability rationale: Material third-party services and their incident obligations are not established by the current intake.

Evidence examples:
- incident clause
- notification procedure
- contact test
- incident report
- corrective-action evidence

Implementation notes: Align supplier obligations with the organization's regulatory, customer, and operational reporting timelines.
Public references: ISO-IEC-42001, NIST-AI-RMF

## AI-VSC-009: Vendor AI assurance and audit rights

Domain: Vendor Supply Chain
Layer: Both

Objective: Obtain sufficient evidence that material supplier AI controls operate as represented.

Requirement: The organization shall obtain proportionate independent assurance, testing information, control evidence, and contractual assessment or audit rights for material AI suppliers and shall track deficiencies and limitations.

Applicability statement: Applies where supplier failure could create material security, privacy, compliance, resilience, or customer impact.

Applicability mode: human_determination
Applicable contexts: general_ai_usage, ai_system, vendor_ai
Applicability rationale: Supplier materiality and available assurance are not established by the current intake.

Evidence examples:
- assurance report
- test summary
- audit clause
- evidence request
- deficiency tracker

Implementation notes: General security reports may not cover model behavior, training-data use, tenant isolation, or AI-specific incident processes.
